# FORM
This is my first PHP project, showcasing a simple web form built using HTML, CSS, and PHP. The project demonstrates basic form handling on the server side, including collecting and processing user input through a clean, responsive interface.  It's a great starting point for learning back-end fundamentals using PHP.
